# NYC CitiBike Analysis
## Overview 
NYC has a well established bike sharing program funded through Citi Bank. We are looking to evaluate and determine their key program factors, to pitch a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa.
## Results
Key CitiBike Findings: <br>

Overall we see three main main findings with the data provided. 1. Younger customers tend to take longer trips 2. Males take up to 2/3 of the total trips 3. The majority of bike rides are started in central Manhattan. Intially knowing this information we look to dive deeper into our analysis.<br>

Looking at the the total time taking for each trip, we see that that most trips taken are 30 minutes or less. We also see that there are very few trips taken that are longer than 60 minutes long.<br>

Knowing that males make up the most trips taken we look further to see how durations relate to those trips taken by females. Both males and females have a majority of trips taken that only last 10-15 minutes. Males have around 110k where females have around 30k. Female total trips drop off at 20 minutes and males drops off at 30 minutes.<br>

Looking at the heat map of where the most trips are taken we see that throughout the week the largest concentration of rides are taken from 6-8am and from 4-7pm. This looks to be around the start and end of the work days for the majority of people. We also see that there are a higher concentration of rides taken over the weekend versus the weekdays.<br>

Breaking down this analysis further by gender we see that males and females follow the same general pattern, but the unknown gender accounts have a larger concentration of rides taken on the weekend. We can hypothesis that these accounts are from tourists and may have a guest account.<br>

Finally we look to see how consumers that have a subscription and those that do not compair throughout the week. We see that males hold the most subsriptions as they are consistantly taking rides throughout the week. We also see that the nonsubscribers with unknown genders ride the most on the weekend. We saw this earlier and can infer that these are just tourists in the area.<br>

## Summary
Overall, we see that males use the bike swaps the most. Generally we see this system being used as a source of transportation to get to work. This is a great program for metropolitan areas and we would see success in a city such as Des Moines, Iwoa. Further we would like to evaluate the flow of traffic of the bikes to see if there are times throughout the day where bikes are not present, resulting in the program not being taken advantage of. Also, we would like to see a relation of distances traveled in relation to the time of day as we look to narrow in the main reasons this program is being used for.
